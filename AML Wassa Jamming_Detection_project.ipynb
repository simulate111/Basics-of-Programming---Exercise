        "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has become a critical part of hour society. It is vital for personal navigation, air and marine traffic, logistics, farming, and many other applications. It also provide precise timing for smart power grids, banking sector, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "During recent years, GNSS Jamming (blocking) and spoofing (fake GNSS data) have become serious problems. The picture from [GPS Jam](https://gpsjam.org/) web site, shows the real time jamming situation in 17th of October 2024.\n",

        "One step forward to protect from GNSS jamming, is to detect it. It is difficult to get controlled data about jamming, because GNSS jamming is illegal, and cannot be done in the field. There is, however, one place in Europe, where GNSS jamming and spoofing can be made during speficic campaings. We participated this year in the [Jammertest2024](https://jammertest.no/jammertest/) event in Bleik, Norway, and collected a lot of data with different equipment.\n",

        "- It is probably easiest to start with `nmea.csv`, which contains timestamp, latitude and longitude. These values are extracted from `GPGGA` messages from `gnss_log_2024_09_10_14_21_50.nmea`.\n",

        "- The satellite observations before any processing, are stored in Rinex file `gnss_log_2024_09_10_14_21_50.nmea`\n",
        "   - The full RINEX specification is [here](https://files.igs.org/pub/data/format/rinex305.pdf?_gl=1*3fgn2n*_ga*MTkyOTM0NjYzMi4xNzI5MDA1MjE0*_ga_Z5RH7R682C*MTcyOTE5OTI5MS4yLjAuMTcyOTE5OTI5OC41My4wLjA.&_ga=2.185390953.157231000.1729199293-1929346632.1729005214)\n",

The `gnss_log_2024_09_10_14_21_50.pos` -file contains this pre-calculated position information, calculated only on raw satellite measurements\n",
        "   - The `.pos` -file contains also much more information than only the position.\n",
        "   - A lot of more information about RTKlib and position are in the  [RTKlib explorer blog](https://rtklibexplorer.wordpress.com/)\n",
        "- The car odometer data in files `odometer_2024-09-10T1407.log` and `odometer_2024-09-10T1429.log` can be also useful, since it is free from spoofing or jamming\n",
